# automatic-bartender
During the summer of 2019, my housemates and I realized that we had the engineering ability to create an automatic bartender. We had no intention of going public with this product, but it was more something that would be a fun project to build with a nice reward. While we did create a house of quality as part of our QFD, our basic technical requirements can be summarized as the following:

- Can create 200 unique mixed drinks when fully operational
  - This translates to needing room for about 16 bottles
- Can fit through a standard American house door (less than 30 inches wide in at least one dimension)
- Can pour individual ingredients within a 2 mL of their setpoint volumes
- Must be made of NSF (The sanitation foundation) approved materials 
- Can maintain an internal temperature of no greater than 50 degrees F. 

Upon creating our first prototype, we were succcessful for all requirements but the setpoint values and the internal temperature. Since we made the material out of 1/4" thick particle board, we were unsuccessful in keeping the temperature low. Secondly, we failed to account for the change in a given bottle's volume when calculating the duration necessary for the bottle's correspinding pump to be kept on when pouring. Regardless, we are quite pleased with this result and when the funds return to our bank accounts, we hope to build a more professional-looking second iteration, hopefully using CAD this time.
